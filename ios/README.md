## mobile: photo picker challenge

<img src="http://cl.ly/image/3b3Y0i3Q0230/download/picker.PNG" align="right" width="200"> At [Moments](https://coderwall.com/team/moments) we use [Path](https://path.com/) and we love their photo chooser. **But we think that it can be improved.**

Download their application, use it, love it, and imagine a better photo chooser.

Imagine what you want, a new UI, a new UX, or just a Moments designed one.

Some stupid ideas but why not:
* Blue?
* Location?
* Cow?
* Date?
* Path?
* Slider?
* Many picz?
