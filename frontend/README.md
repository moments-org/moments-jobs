## web: photo viewer challenge

<img src="http://cl.ly/image/3G073h0S0g41/download/everpix-2.jpg" align="right" width="200" alt="We miss you, Everpix."> At Moments we think that photos are the main medium of memory.

Even if you missed him last time he stopped at your town, you can not disagree.

In this project you will find an html page, that loads a json and displays all pictures with comments and some other information.

So much data, that doesn't help visitors appreciate the pictures at their full potential.

We expect you to improve this page in order to highlight photos viewing. All informations have to remain accessible in some way (directly visible or visible after some action).

To launch server and start work launch ```grunt install```, ```npm install``` and then ```npm start```.

Some ideas to think about: 
* Responsiveness?
* UX?
* Family?
* Goal?
* Wisdom?
* Many picz?
* HTML5 compliant?

### result expected
