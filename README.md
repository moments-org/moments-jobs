## you...
- want to build something you're proud of, and maybe [change the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc), too
- enjoy working in English
- love to learn by cracking problems
- hate [spaghetti](http://xkcd.com/292/)
- can't stop yourself from suggesting improvements when you see some, and building them when you can...
- ... but you already refused to code something that you didn't think fulfilled a need
- want to ship at ~~warp~~ startup speed
- [don't just code](http://venturehacks.com/articles/1-wo-man-startups): you listen to users and use code to solve their problems
- [don't fit in a square cubicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different#Text)

## we...
... are a small team of builders:
- convinced that it is better to be small, but talented and [persevering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg)
- certain that [the very best talent doesn't live in one place](http://37signals.com/remote/)
- already planning to be in the US market soon
- supported by visionary investors
